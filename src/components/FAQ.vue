              <a href="https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/">there are</a>. I have not tested the limits so I do not know for sure, but probably max 800MB for Firefox and 2GB for Chrome. Feedback appreciated!

            <v-card-title>What is the tech stack used for this application?</v-card-title>
            <v-card-text>
              The frontend application is built using Vue + Typescript and Vuetify for components/styling.
              CodeFlask is used for the code editor.
              The application is hosted using Netlify.

            <v-card-title>Why does the code editor look like crap?</v-card-title>
            <v-card-text>CSS ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Sadly, I could not figure out a way to stop Vuetify from messing with the CSS of the code editor, so I had to brute force a solution.</v-card-text>
